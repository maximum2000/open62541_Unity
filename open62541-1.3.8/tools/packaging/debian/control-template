Description: Open source implementation of OPC UA - shared library
 open62541 (http://open62541.org) is an open source and free implementation
 of OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) written in the common subset of the
 C99 and C++98 languages.
 The library is usable with all major compilers and provides the necessary
 tools to implement dedicated OPC UA clients and servers, or to integrate
 OPC UA-based communication into existing applications.
 .
 This package provides the open62541 shared library
